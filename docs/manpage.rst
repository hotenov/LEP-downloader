Man Page
========

.. important::
   This page uses auto-generation of ``--help`` option
   for 'download' command and script itself *(without command)*.

   To download files you can use only options (without 'download' command).
   They are the same.

   If you don't know how to read and use ``--help`` output,
   you should visit `Usage Examples`_ page (with "copy-paste" instructions)
