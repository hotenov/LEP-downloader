Why? (Motivation)
=================

I'm learning two languages at the moment: Python and English.

And I've decided to *kill two birds with one stone*.

To learn programming language is better on real project.
For real users. Even though that user is only you.
I was lucky - I had a broken one *(a project, not a user =)*.

Developing version 3 of the script I've learned a lot of new things
and managed to improve it significantly *(I hope so)*.

In addition, the **LEP Downloader** enables us to have
offline collection of the great podcast for English learners.
