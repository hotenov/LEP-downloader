About
------

LEP Downloader is a script for downloading the all FREE episodes of `Luke's ENGLISH Podcast`_.

It lets you to get all audio files (including audio tracks to video episodes)
and also PDF files for each episode page.

Even though this script was written for convenient episode downloading,
I don't want to financially harm Luke in any way.
I just want to make my life a bit easier (as usual for lazy IT person =).
So consider `donating`_ to Luke's English Podcast and `becoming`_ his premium subscriber.
And of course, subscribe on his `YouTube channel`_.

   python -m pip install --user pipx
   pipx install lep-downloader
   lep-downloader --help

   lep-downloader -ep 758

You can also use the short script name:

.. code:: none

   lep-dl --last

Please see the `Usage Examples <Usage_>`_ for details.

Or skim the `Man Page <Manpage_>`_ for available options
(if terminal is your best friend).


‚ú® What's new in version 3
---------------------------

The third version was completely re-written by me (again).
But this time with more fundamental and mature approach.
I applied some OOP (object-oriented programming) principles
and covered almost all functions with absolutely isolated unit tests.

Code base became more extendable and maintainable *(I believe)*.
I dropped support for file naming from old script versions.
Also I removed (for awhile) video and add-ons download
*(I plan to add them again in the future, however - no any promises)*.

Archive parsing was improved (without skipping several episodes).
Also I added built-in possibility to download files from reserve server,
if primary link is not available (for any reason).

And many internal little things.
You can read descriptions of pre-releases on `Releases`_ page (if you wish).
